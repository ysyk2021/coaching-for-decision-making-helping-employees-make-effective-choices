### Active Listening

Active listening is a technique that involves fully engaging with the person speaking and demonstrating understanding through verbal and nonverbal cues. By actively listening, coaches can build rapport with employees and create a safe space for open communication.

### Empathy

Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. By demonstrating empathy, coaches can show employees that they are valued and understood. Empathy can also help coaches identify underlying concerns or obstacles that may be hindering employees' decision-making abilities.

### Asking Open-Ended Questions

Asking open-ended questions encourages employees to share their thoughts and ideas in a non-judgmental environment. Open-ended questions can also help coaches identify areas where employees may need additional support or guidance.

### Providing Constructive Feedback

Providing constructive feedback helps employees understand how they can improve their decision-making abilities. Coaches should focus on providing specific, actionable feedback that is tailored to each employee's individual needs.

### Cultivating Trust

Cultivating trust is essential for building strong relationships with employees. Coaches can build trust by being consistent, transparent, and supportive. It's important to demonstrate that employees' best interests are a top priority.
